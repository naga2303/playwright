each tab represent a page. Once browser instance can have multiple page instances.
5) what is async({page})?
-> async refers that the function is asynchronous and it allows to use await and also handles the promises
in a more synchronous manner.
--> {page} -> it's extracting the page property from the object passed as an argument to the function.
This is used when we expect object as an parameter so that the methods/properties of that class/functions can be 
used.By representing like this, page can be used as an variable in the code block without explicitly 
accessing the properties of the object.
